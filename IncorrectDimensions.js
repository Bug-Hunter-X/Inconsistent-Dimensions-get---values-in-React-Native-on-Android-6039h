This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` may return incorrect values, or `undefined`, initially or after certain actions like screen rotation.  This can lead to layouts that are misaligned or broken.

```javascript
//Incorrect Dimensions
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log(width, height); //May output undefined or incorrect values
```
